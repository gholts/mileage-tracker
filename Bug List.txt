When closing out of the list events, the calendar fails to retain Administration privilieges.
Its fucking annoying.

When adding event with a special character (ie. ' ! ?) the name will be messed up in the database.
It's pretty fucking annoying.

If you click close, it strips admin rights and doesn't even close the window.
